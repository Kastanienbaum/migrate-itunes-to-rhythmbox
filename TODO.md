- migrate count and ratings
    - add command to cli
        - update README
    - test case, where there is already a play_count and rating in rhythmdb. correctly executed? see integrate_value_to_rhythmdb_song_entry()
    - optional/fix tests:
        - child tags not in same position; test equality with lxml? sort tags? sort-all-chars-trick?  
        - set last-played? use value from itunes? remove them from expected file
- create release
    - pyb doesn't support URLs in requirements.txt.
    - a) wait for a fix. see https://github.com/pybuilder/pybuilder/issues/388
    - b) prepare pyItunes to be uploaded to PyPi. see https://github.com/liamks/pyitunes/issues/28
    - c) move away from pyb. use plain setup.py instead. do test execution and packaging manually.
    - d) move away from pyItunes. re-implement the relevant parts.
    - moreover, add setup.py infos (author, url, license etc.) 
    - finally update README pointing to the uploaded release
