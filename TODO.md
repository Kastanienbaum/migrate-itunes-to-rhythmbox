- migrate count and ratings
    - test case, where there is already a play_count and rating in rhythmdb. correctly executed? see integrate_value_to_rhythmdb_song_entry(). simply adjust the input rhythmdb and add those cases.
    - optional/fix tests:
        - last_played date is not equals, but can be due to different creation times... 2h diff! due to wrong time under win -> fix expected xml file!
        - child tags not in same position; test equality with lxml? sort tags? sort-all-chars-trick?  
        - what if itunes file is not contained in rythmbox?
    - finally: test it with real library
- create release
    - finally update README pointing to the uploaded release
